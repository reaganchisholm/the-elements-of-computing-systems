# Boolean Arithmetic

## Background 

- An ALU is a Arithmetic Logical Unit
- Its the centerpiece chip that executes all the arithmetic and logical operations performed by the computer
- A lot of operations performed by digital computers can be reduced to elementary additions of binary numbers

### Binary 
- Binary is base 2
- A pair of binary numbers can be added digit by digit from right to left, similar to the same elementary school method used in decimal addition

### Signed Binary Numbers
- A binary system with n digits can generate a set of 2<sub>n</sub> different bit patterns
- There are a few different coding schemes that implement signed numbers in different ways, but the most common today is called the _2's complement_ method, also known as the _radix complement_
- The first number is the sign number, which determines if its positive or negative, hence the name _Signed Binary Numbers_
