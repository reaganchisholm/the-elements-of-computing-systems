# Boolean Logic

- Elementary logic gates make up all types of computers no matter the shape or size.
- Can build many of the other logic gates out of the primitive Nand gate
- Use all the standard logic gates to construct 

## Background

### Boolean Algebra
- Boolean algebra only deals with boolean values (true/false, 1/0, yes/no, on/off)
- Boolean functions play a central role in the specification, construction, and optimization of hardware architectures.
