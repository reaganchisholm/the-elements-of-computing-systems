# Computer Architecture

- **stored program concept**
    - the foundation of modern comouter science
    - the storage of instructions in a computers memory
    - essentially what we know as "software" today
    - hardware platform is separated from the "software" and can run different software that behaves completely different from another piece of software
- **von Neumann architecture**
    - practical architecture and the conceptual blueprint of almost all computer platforms today
    - includes a CPU that interacts with memory, receiving data from some input device and sends it out to some output device.
    - the memory includes both the data that the computer manipulates, but also the instructions that tell the computer what to do

- Optimization takes a huge role in industrial-strength computers.
